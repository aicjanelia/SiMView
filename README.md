# SiMView Processing Scripts and Plugins

The ImageJ/FIJI plugins in src/imagej can be used to fuse SiMView data sets using [BigStitcher](https://imagej.net/plugins/bigstitcher/).  A protocol for using BigStitcher with SiMView can be found here: [https://knowledge.aicjanelia.org/posts/20210706-simview-reconstruction/](https://knowledge.aicjanelia.org/posts/20210706-simview-reconstruction/).

The materials in bin and src/matlab are prior versions of the SiMView processing pipeline.
